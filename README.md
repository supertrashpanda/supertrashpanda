### Hi there 👋
This is Yunfan Ling, and I am a graduate student at Columbia University. I love to practice coding more, for various digital interative art projects I've been always wanting to undertake. So sad I'm just a complete beginner, but it's OK to be a beginner as long as there is progress to make.
Currently I am working on a machine that can transform the sound of the wind (aeolian sound 💨 ) to fine verses/lines of poetry📝. Looking forward to collaborating with anyone who's interested in this idea.
