### Hi there 👋
This is Yunfan Ling, and I am learning coding for various digital interative art projects I've always been wanting to undertake.

Currently I am planning to build a mobile App that can transform the sound of the wind (aeolian sound 💨 ) to fine verses/lines of poetry📝. I look forward to collaborating with you if you are interested in this idea.
